  This article highlights the importance of the Hydrological cycle as well as the importance of purifying water. 
 Specifically, the purification method of UV light is highlighted in this article.
 Overall despite the disadvantages of using UV light for purifying water, it is ultimately a good method due to it’s efficiency, environmental impacts and it’s variability.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) is the specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for global public health.
 They describe the word Potable as “water delivered to the consumer that can be safely used for drinking, cooking and washing… should have palatability (pleasant to taste) with reasonable temperature” (Dezuane et al.,1996).

  Analysing a water cycle and its distribution for a given location is an essential step to controlling the quality of drinking water.  
A deep understanding of hydrology, the study of “occurrence, distribution movement and properties of the water of the earth”, is crucial in understanding the water cycle and its affects.  
The components of a hydrologic cycle include precipitation(P), infiltration (I), evaporation (E), transpiration (T), surface runoff (R), and ground water flow (G).  
A property that affects the hydrologic cycle in an area is the amount of vegetation present. Plants take up infiltrated water and groundwater.  
Some of this water may emerge as surface water bodies whilst some other portions of water become groundwater flow.  
This water may become discharged into streams or freshwater springs.  
The higher the volume of these freshwater sources the easier the disinfectant process is and the easier the distribution process of the clean water is.  
 
Most potable water is sourced from rainwater however many paths are taken by a water droplet that may affect the quality of the water.  
For example, near big cities, the water droplet may become contaminated by air pollution, the water droplet running on contaminated surfaces before reaching its collection point i.e. a dam, or the water droplet may contain chemical impurities (chemicals that have similar boiling points to water and were evaporated 
and condensated at similar temperatures e.g. acid rain) , an issue that is commonly found near chemical processing or power plants.  
The Hydrologic budget refers to the amount of fresh water that a region has as it accounts for the inflow, outflow and storage of water in a designated hydrologic system (Viessman et al., 2002). 
This budget can be derived into a formula; 

Surface flow  
P + R1 – R2 + Rg – Es – Ts – I = ∆ Ss 

Underground flow 
I + G1 – G2 – Rg – Eg – Tg – I = ∆ Sg  

Due to the many ways that water could be polluted during the hydrological cycle as well as it’s uneven distribution of precipitation, some may suggest that relying too heavily on it is not practical.  
However, due to the important and necessary nutrients, minerals and pathogens recycled in the hydrologic cycle as well as elements in the ecosystem I would argue that the hydrological cycle is the most important part of extracting potable water.
