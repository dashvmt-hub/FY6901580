  This article highlights the importance of the Hydrological cycle as well as the importance of purifying water. 
 Specifically, the purification method of UV light is highlighted in this article.
 Overall despite the disadvantages of using UV light for purifying water, it is ultimately a good method due to it’s efficiency, environmental impacts and it’s variability.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) is the specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for global public health.
 They describe the word Potable as “water delivered to the consumer that can be safely used for drinking, cooking and washing… should have palatability (pleasant to taste) with reasonable temperature” (Dezuane et al.,1996).

Analysing a water cycle and its distribution for a given location is an essential step to controlling the quality of drinking water.  
A deep understanding of hydrology, the study of “occurrence, distribution movement and properties of the water of the earth”, is crucial in understanding the water cycle and its affects.  
The components of a hydrologic cycle include precipitation(P), infiltration (I), evaporation (E), transpiration (T), surface runoff (R), and ground water flow (G).  
A property that affects the hydrologic cycle in an area is the amount of vegetation present. Plants take up infiltrated water and groundwater.  
Some of this water may emerge as surface water bodies whilst some other portions of water become groundwater flow.  
This water may become discharged into streams or freshwater springs.  
The higher the volume of these freshwater sources the easier the disinfectant process is and the easier the distribution process of the clean water is.

Most potable water is sourced from rainwater however many paths are taken by a water droplet that may affect the quality of the water.  
For example, near big cities, the water droplet may become contaminated by air pollution, the water droplet running on contaminated surfaces before reaching its collection point i.e. a dam, 
or the water droplet may contain chemical impurities (chemicals that have similar boiling points to water and were evaporated 
and condensated at similar temperatures e.g. acid rain) , an issue that is commonly found near chemical processing or power plants.  
The Hydrologic budget refers to the amount of fresh water that a region has as it accounts for the inflow, outflow and storage of water in a designated hydrologic system '<a href="https://pdfcoffee.com/introduction-to-hydrology-5th-edition-by-warren-viessman-jr-gary-l-lewis-pdf-free.html"> (Viessman et al., 2002).</a>a>' 
This budget can be derived into a formula; 

Surface flow  
P + R1 – R2 + Rg – Es – Ts – I = ∆ Ss 

Underground flow 
I + G1 – G2 – Rg – Eg – Tg – I = ∆ Sg  

Due to the many ways that water could be polluted during the hydrological cycle as well as it’s uneven distribution of precipitation, some may suggest that relying too heavily on it is not practical.  
However, due to the important and necessary nutrients, minerals and pathogens recycled in the hydrologic cycle as well as elements in the ecosystem I would argue that 
the hydrological cycle is the most important part of extracting potable water.

Water purification is essential to ensure drinking water is clean and free from harmful pollutants. 
There are a range of water purification techniques that ensure that the chemical, microbiological and physical quality of water meet not only the local regulatory standards but also the standards set by the WHO.
During this process, the water is tested for pathogens like bacteria, viruses and protozoa as well as measuring the levels of chemical contaminants such as heavy metals, Pesticides and nitrates.
Common methods of water purification include filtration, chlorination, UV disinfection and advanced oxidation processes. These methods alongside routine sampling, analysis and timely intervention are
imperative to prevent waterborne diseases and to ensure that drinking water quality is high.
(Thomson, M., Green, D. and Kumar, A., 2020. Water distribution systems: Challenges and innovations in clean water delivery. Water Resources Management, 34(6), pp.1763-1778.) 

UV radiation has recently become a popular way of purifying water due to its ability to efficiently inactivate harmful microorganisms. 
Although UV light purification was discovered as early as 1801, the first UV water sterilizer was not constructed until 1910 in Marseille, (Adam Bert (2024) Nordic-Tec). UV radiation, 
particularly UV – C light (wavelengths between 200 to 280 nm), penetrates the cells of microorganisms in the water and causes irreversible damage to the DNA and RNA of the pathogen.
These pathogens therefore lose their ability to reproduce thus eliminating their ability to cause disease. UV disinfection has been widely used in municipal water treatment plants as well as in 
household and portable water purification systems making UV radiation quite versatile (Koudio et al., 2017).
This process produces little to no waste therefore rendering it environmentally friendly. 
It also adheres to WHO standards as the by products do not change the taste or odour of the water.

The efficiency of UV disinfection is influenced by factors such as water quality, turbidity (measure of water clarity, how cloudy or muddy the water is), and the intensity of the UV light.
Unfiltered water may have a high turbidity and may therefore cause negative effects on the efficiency of UV light. 
This is because the high concentration of particles present in the water may absorb, scatter, or block the UV light (Qualls et al, 1983). 
To counter this, pretreatment methods such as filtration are often necessary to improve water clarity before UV treatment. 

UV disinfection technology has proven especially valuable in decentralized or off-grid settings, where access to traditional water treatment infrastructure is limited such as for 
emergency water disinfection, particularly in areas affected by natural disasters or in rural communities. 
UV disinfection is not only effective in removing bacteria, viruses, and protozoa but also reduces the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis (Hijnen et al., 2006). 
As the demand for clean drinking water grows globally, UV disinfection is expected to remain a key technology in ensuring safe and reliable water access. 

Finally, the distribution of clean water involves the infrastructure and systems used to deliver potable water must not only be safe but also easy to access by the consumer. 
The most common method of distribution of water is through a network of pipes. 
Water is typically pumped from treatment plants to reservoirs before being distributed. 
To ensure the water remains clean during distribution, maintenance and monitoring are crucial to prevent contamination through leaks, pipe corrosion, or improper handling (Thomson et al., 2020).
